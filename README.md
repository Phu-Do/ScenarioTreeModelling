# Scenario Tree Modelling


# Content

1. Scenario Tree Model 
2. Component Sensitivities
3. Manual sensitivity analysis
4. Raw output files (gonococcal detection)
5. Raw output files (antibiotic resistance)
6. Scenario Tree (requires ModelRisk)


# Instructions

1. Please install the necessary font file for the graphs produced and custom theme
	a. HelveticaNeueLTProRoman

	a. All necessary libraries and files have been included within the supplementary information
3. Run component sensitivities file which will give individual component sensitivities based on the Scenario Tree Model
4. Run manual sensitivity analysis (optional)



 # Troubleshooting

If there are any problems please ensure
1. Font is installed, or alternatively the themes for the plots can be changed from
	a. `base_family="HelveticaNeueLT Pro 55 Roman"` to `base_family = "Arial"`
2. Please ensure all packages have been installed probably for the package to work
3. Ensure the files have been run in the correct order
	a. Scenario Tree Model
	b. Component Sensitivities
	c. Manual sensitivity analysis
4. Excel files requires ModelRisk. However, summary statistics for analysis are still viewable.
